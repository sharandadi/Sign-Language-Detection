# Sign-Language-Detection
Open-source sign language detection model that leverages the power of MediaPipe Holistic, computer vision, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Developed with TensorFlow and Keras, this project aims to bridge communication gaps by enabling real-time translation of sign language into text and speech.
