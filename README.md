#Sign Language Detection using Action Recognition with LSTM Neural Networks
Overview
This GitHub repository contains code and resources for a Sign Language Detection system built using Action Recognition with LSTM Neural Networks, leveraging the power of MediaPipe and TensorFlow. Sign language detection plays a crucial role in enabling communication between individuals with hearing impairments and those who do not know sign language.

Introduction
Sign Language Detection is a challenging task that involves recognizing and interpreting the gestures and movements of the human hand and body to understand sign language expressions. In this repository, we present an approach using LSTM neural networks for action recognition, powered by the MediaPipe framework for hand and pose detection and TensorFlow for deep learning.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
MediaPipe
NumPy
OpenCV
You can install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow mediapipe numpy opencv-python
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-detection.git
cd sign-language-detection
Usage
Prepare your dataset or use the provided dataset.
Configure the model and training parameters in config.py.
Train the model using train.py.
Evaluate the model using evaluate.py.
Run inference on videos or webcam using inference.py.
Dataset
You can use your own sign language dataset or explore publicly available datasets. Ensure your dataset is properly preprocessed and organized. Update the dataset paths and labels in config.py.

Model Architecture
Our model uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for action recognition. The model architecture is defined in models.py.

Training
To train the model, run train.py with appropriate configurations. You can choose to train from scratch or fine-tune a pre-trained model.

Inference
You can perform inference on videos or webcam feeds using inference.py. This script loads the trained model and detects sign language in real-time or on video files.

Results
We provide evaluation metrics, sample videos, and visualizations of the model's performance in the results directory.
